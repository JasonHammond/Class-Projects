Scripts written for mySQL; should work fine with Postgres, but this cannot currently be guaranteed.

Before running, please create database 'investment.'

Test data generated by testgen/testgen2.py. testgen2.py provides real human names, but requires the "names" library from Trey Hunner's github page. testgen.py uses strings of random characters in place of names. Special thanks goes out to Trey Hunner:

Test data associates agent-client relationships with agents and clients that exist in the system. However, transactions do not adhere to this set of relationships; that is, agents and clients are chosen randomly from the full lists of agents/clients, rather than from the relationships themselves. This would be consistent with a business model that doesn't assign agent-client relationships, but causes some inconsistencies with this model.

testgen.py and testgen2.py are included and can be used to generate new data sets. If desired, testdata.sql (random string names) or testdata2.sql (actual names) can be used instead.
